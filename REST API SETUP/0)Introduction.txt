RESTful APIs The API user is the web developer who can build a script that connects into an external API server, then the necessary data is passed over HTTP. ... Generally speaking there are four commands used to access RESTful APIs: GET for retrieving an object. POST for creating a new object.

REST is just a series of guidelines and architectural styles used for data transmission. It's commonly applied to web applications, but can pass data to software as well. The acronym API stands for Application Programming Interface, which are methods of connecting with other libraries or applications
